### Hello! My name is Miguel Torres.

## IT Professional specializing in Web Development and Web Design

Working with technology is something I've always enjoyed. After graduating from college with a Bachelor's in Computer Information Systems in 2018, my eagerness to learn more about the different Programing languages and Trends in the IT field lead me to finding a career in this industry. At the moment, I am currently working as a Web Developer in Higher education for Joliet Junior College.

<br />

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning: Drupal 11, Acquia Cloud IDE, Sharepoint Online, Microsoft 365 and PowerApps, learning to implement all these features with our external website and portal.

- âš¡ Fun fact: In addition to tech news, I enjoy watching Sports, Anime, and Documentaries (Mainly Animal Docs) in my spare time as well as video games!!!
