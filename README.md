### Hello! My name is Miguel Torres.

Working with technology is something I've always enjoyed way back in High School. My eagerness to learn more about the different Programing languages and Trends in the IT field lead me to finding a career in this industry. Wanting to learn more I graduated with a Bachelor's in CIS in 2018. At the moment, I am currently working as a Web Developer in Higher education for JJC.


- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning: Drupal 8/9, Acquia Cloud IDE, Sharepoint Online, etc...

- âš¡ Fun fact: In edition to tech news, I enjoy watching NFL, Basketball, Anime, and Documentaries (Mainly Animal Docs) in my spare time
