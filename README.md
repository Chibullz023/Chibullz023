### Hello! My name is Miguel Torres.

## IT Professional specializing in Web Development and Web Design

Web Developer with advanced skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, as well as solid experience in Drupal, and Microsoft 365. Working with technology is something I've always enjoyed. After graduating from college with a Bachelor's in Computer Information Systems in 2018, my eagerness to learn more about the different Programing languages and Trends in the IT field lead me to finding a career in this industry. At the moment, I am currently working as a Web Developer in Higher education for Joliet Junior College.
